# About Me!
2020-20121 Portfolio

Hey there, I'm Vincent Nguyen. This portfolio showcases my projects I've been working on in my 2020 iOS Mobile App Development class at Eden Prairie High School. I've learned about using Spreadsheet APKs, basic user interface with SwiftUI, and making a simple game using SpriteKit. I was able to learn a little bit of the basics of Swift through YouTube, Apple Tutorials, and looking at game examples. I've also I'm taking a 2020 Intro to Java Programming class at the University of Minnesota to help build my foundation in programming.

# Projects

I learned how to import data from a google spreadsheet using APKS, create buttons that link to an in-app spreadsheet, and basic user interface.
I originally wanted to use this app to organize my tutoring club links for my tutors, but we found that a linktr.ee would suffice. Nonetheless, this was a good first project into Swift.

Version 1.0

This is my latest project which is a space shooter app called Ghost Pilots. I've learned how to incorporate mathematics and problem solving into my game through its many features such as a ghost take over of enemy ships, handling collisions, and keeping track of data. I plan to transition to an online multiplayer game where players can connnect with others around the globe to either fight each other or team up.
